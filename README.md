# HelpSMS

To do (Prob this weekend):

1. Twilio SMS Send/Receive (Shahzaib working on it. Will be done soon)
2. Google Directions API integration
  - (First message will ask how user is travelling, next will ask from/to location)
3. Translation wrapper (so we can just wrap the incoming/outgoing message in the appropriate language)



Future:
1. WebMD/Medical diagnosis analysis
// Can you think of any other uses?
